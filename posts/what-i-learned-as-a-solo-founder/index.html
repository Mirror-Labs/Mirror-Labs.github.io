<hr />
<p>My first attempt at creating a startup was last year, in 2021.
I had had some early success riding on the NFT craze which ultimately resulted in me
building <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://atomic-swap.io/">Atomic Swap</a>, an open-source p2p trading dApp
on Cardano. Unfortunately, the markets turned, competitors appeared, and I never achieved enough
transactions per day to make Atomic Swap sustainable.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think the competitors or the market was the killer.
It was fatigue.</p>
<p>I was constantly making decisions from everything from design, implementation, to marketing.
I was working both weekdays and weekends.
Constantly worrying about money and Swedish banks’ downright hostile attitude towards crypto.
When I ultimately threw in the towel and landed a 9-to-5 job I realized how important it is
to have colleagues.
To have people to share the burden with, and to give each other energy.
I had been lonely and that had taken the biggest toll.</p>
<p>This time I will do it differently. We will do it differently.</p>
<p>We want to empower developers to build local-first web apps where users can seamlessly
move been mobile and desktop even if they are <em>offline</em>.</p>
<p>To realize this vision we are building <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Mirror-Labs/MirrorDB">MirrorDB: an application-centric p2p database with super powers!</a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immutable</li>
<li>Runs in both browser and server</li>
<li>Real-time Sync
<ul>
<li>WebRTC</li>
<li>LAN</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
<li>USB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fearless asynchronous merging of data</li>
<li>Reactive queries that instantly react to changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get building!</p>
