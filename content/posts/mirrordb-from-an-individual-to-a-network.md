My first attempt at creating a startup was last year, in 2021.
I had had some early success riding on the NFT craze which ultimately resulted in me
building [Atomic Swap](https://atomic-swap.io/), an open-source p2p trading dApp
on Cardano. Unfortunately, the markets turned, competitors appeared, and I never achieved enough
transactions per day to make Atomic Swap sustainable.

However, I don't think the competitors or the market was the killer.
It was fatigue.

I was constantly making decisions from everything from design, implementation, to marketing.
I was working both weekdays and weekends.
Constantly worrying about money and Swedish banksâ€™ downright hostile attitude towards crypto.
When I ultimately threw in the towel and landed a 9-to-5 job I realized how important it is
to have colleagues.
To have people to share the burden with, and to give each other energy.
I had been lonely and that had taken the biggest toll.

This time I will do it differently. We will do it differently.

We want to empower developers to build local-first web apps where users can seamlessly
move been mobile and desktop even if they are _offline_.

To realize this vision we are building [MirrorDB: an application-centric p2p database with super powers!](https://github.com/Mirror-Labs/MirrorDB)

Features:

- Immutable
- Runs in both browser and server
- Real-time Sync
  - WebRTC
  - LAN
  - Bluetooth
  - USB
- Fearless asynchronous merging of data
- Reactive queries that instantly react to changes.

Let's get building!
