# Hi, we are MirrorLabs!

We are bringing the local-first software revolution to the web:

1. No spinners: your data at your fingertips
2. Seamless syncing between devices; It just works!
3. The network is optional
4. Security and privacy by default
5. You retain ultimate ownership and control

We believe that every app is a distributed system: web, mobile, desktop, and server.
Users have come to expect to be able to seamlessly transition between their devices;
their data magically always being up-to-date. Today, this is most easily achieved by server-client-based solutions such as Firebase where Google ultimately retains control.
Sacrificing our users' privacy, ownership, and access to _their_ data.

We are building MirrorDB: an application-centric p2p database.
